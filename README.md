This project together with the [Wegtam Weather
Client](https://github.com/wegtam/weather-client) project resulted
from an internship by [Florian Drews](https://github.com/fd86) within
our company ([Wegtam UG](http://www.wegtam.org)).

We decided to make it available as open source under the bsd license.

It is still work in progress.
